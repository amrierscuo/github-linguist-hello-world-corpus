# 0085 C++: variant `.re`

Role: Re2c source embedded in C++; not a simple alias .cpp.

Type: **adapted**. Starting model: examples/#085 C++/hello.cpp; adattato/originale content for this suffix.

Original variable adapted to the role of the suffix; the existing main files are not modified. No verification is inherited from the model.

## Verification command or procedure

From the directory of the variant, except for explicit references to the model. `<output>`
indicates an external temporary directory; dependencies and compiled products do not
part of the deliverable.

```text
re2c hello.re -o <output>/hello.cpp; g++ <output>/hello.cpp -o <output>/hello; <output>/hello
```

Expected result: Hello, World!

## Status

Artefatto: **created**.
syntax: **not verified**. behavior: **not verified**.
No positive flag is inherited from the main sample or another suffix.
Checking only the bytes or metadata does not establish parsing or execution.

Remaining requirements:
- The variant has not yet been checked with the native toolchain indicated.
