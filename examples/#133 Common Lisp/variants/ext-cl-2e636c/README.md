# 0133 Common Lisp: variant `.cl`

Role: Common Lisp/S-expression Shapes; this suffix remains in Common Lisp, not in the omonymous dialects of other folders.

Tipo variante: **alias**. Copia byte-identica di examples/#133 Common Lisp/hello.lisp

Byte-identical copy of the stated model: byte equality is not equivalent to a new toolchain test on the new suffix.

## Verification command or procedure

From the directory of the variant, except for explicit references to the model. `<output>`
indicates an external temporary directory; dependencies and compiled products do not
part of the deliverable.

```text
sbcl --script hello.cl
```

Exit 0; stdout Hello, World! followed by newline.

## Status

Artefatto: **created**.
syntax: **not verified**. behavior: **not verified**.
No positive flag is inherited from the main sample or another suffix.
Checking only the bytes or metadata does not establish parsing or execution.

Remaining requirements:
- The variant has not yet been checked with the native toolchain indicated.
